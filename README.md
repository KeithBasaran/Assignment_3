Networks and Distributed Systems - Socket.io Assignment.
The application that was developed is a chat room application.
It provides clients who have connected to the room, with a unique ID.
The console will update if a client is connected or disconnected from the application.
In order to run the application, the user must first open a command window and run the command "node server.js" or "nodemon server.js".
This will start up an Express webserver.
Open up a web browser and enter "http://localhost:3000".
This will send a GET request for the root folder, in this case "/public/index.html".
